# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

A recap to data structures and algorithms enjoying [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen) and his [free course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/algorithms/).

Took the chance to try out go the first time.

## 1. Arrays / Array Lists

### Search Algorithms

- [x] [Linear Search](./arrays/linearsearch.go)
- [x] [Binary Search](./arrays/binarysearch.go)

### Sorting Algorithms

- [x] [Bubble Sort](./arrays/bubblesort.go)
- [x] [Quick Sort](./arrays/quicksort.go)
- [ ] Merge Sort

### Other Algorithms

- [x] [Two Crystal Ball Problem](./arrays/bubblesort.go)
- [x] [Recursive Maze Solver](./arrays/mazesolver.go)
- [ ] Trapping Rain Water Problem

### Abstract data structures

- [x] [Ring Buffer](./arrays/ringbuffer.go)

## 2. Linked Lists

- [x] [Queue](./lists/queue.go)
- [x] [Stack](./lists/stack.go)
- [x] [Double LinkedList](./lists/doublelinkedlist.go)
