# Data Structures and Algorithms in Go

Tests and algorithms are implemented in Go.

## 1. Arrays

I used slices to implement those algorithms. Technically
they are no arrays but I wanted to be flexible regarding the length
of the lists.

### Search Algorithms

- [x] Linear Search
- [x] Binary Search

### Sorting Algorithms

- [x] Bubble Sort
- [ ] Quick Sort
- [ ] Merge Sort

### Other Algorithms

- [x] Two Crystal Ball Problem
- [ ] Trapping Rain Water Problem
